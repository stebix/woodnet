Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation for the ``woodnet`` package.
It is an purpose-built package for data processing
and in-depth training and evaluation of deep learning-based
classification in the context of wood microstructure images.

We developed the code framework in conjunction with the research project of
furthering the role of advanced volumetric computed tomography (CT) imaging techniques
in wood scientific research and applications [#]_ [#]_.

The current core use case is the classification of wood images in the context
of traditional 2D imagery, multiplanar 2D imagery, and 3D volumetric imagery.
The flexible architecture allows adaptation to photographic imaging,
optical micrographs and cross sections as well as advanced volumetric imaging
techniques like sub-Î¼-CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
