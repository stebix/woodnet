Triaxial Datasets
=================

The triaxial datasets module provides facilities to create
and use datasets that create elements by concatenating three
orthogonal 2D slices along the channel dimension.
The planes are extracted subvolumes of the 3D base volume
according to the given tileshape configuration.
